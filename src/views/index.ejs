      <h1>Tracker Project</h1>
      <p>
        This is the tracker project. Basically, I want a way to track certain things.
        And I want a playground in which to do a bit of javascript and nodejs work.
      </p>
      <p>
        Be forewarned, my html and css... and js are not what you might call... good.
        So, bare with me as I figure out how to move from super strict Java land into 
        devil may care frontier world of Javascript.
        Maybe I'll bring in TypeScript to make things a bit more rigid for me, but we'll
        see. No need for it yet, trying to stay as light as possible until I need more
        complexity.

      <p>The Tracked Items will have a date and a score</p>
      <p>Build reports based on data over time for these Trackers</p>
